# Age-Gender-Ethnicity-Classifier
In this project we aim to explore a dataset of images of people from different backgrounds and build a neural network image classifier to classify the age, gender and ethnicity of people in images. We deal with three different tasks in the project. These are gender classification which is a binary classification problem while age prediction is a regression problem since the output of the network can be any discrete number. Our last problem is that of ethnicity classification which is a multi class classification problem. All these tasks are important and useful in several fields and hence developing an efficient classification model can be helpful in solving the problems. For example, classifying ethnicity is an important task to solve for federal authorities and many companies developing photo editing applications.
